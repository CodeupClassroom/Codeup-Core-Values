# Codeup-Core-Values

This project was inspired by csszengarden.com, which is a site that uses a single content/markup and applies different css to astounding results.
Think of it as a "Coloring Book for Web Developers".
You can fork this repo or create a branch. Add all the CSS you want to make it your own, and also add your answers to the questions "What do these values mean to you?"
